# Task_1 Practice

> Create a directory called task1. 

> Search for a command to create a file.

> Create a directory called **subtask2** in another directory called **subtask1** int the **task1** directory with **one** command 

> return back to the parent **task1** with **one** command

> Search for the command that creats a file. and create a file called **task.txt**. Write anything in this file. 

> Search for a command to display the content of that file on terminal. 

> copy this file in **subtask2** directory

> create a c++ file called task.cpp
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Linux Community :)\n";
  return 0;
}

``` 
> Search for the command that recognizes the type of data contained in a file, run this command on the child directory, the text file and the c++ file and see the differences.

> how to know the last modification time of a file using **ls** command.

> After using the last command and seeing the whole format, what these letters stand for [r, x, w, d]

# Remember, Always Search
# Good Luck :)
